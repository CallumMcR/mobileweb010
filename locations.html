                                    Burghley House is a privately owned property by Burghley that is open to the public,
                                    allowing you to venture around their lands. Burghley consists of deers and stags in
                                    the summer, and sheep in the winter, letting you watch and see the beauty of nature
                                    in its natural form.

                                    Burghley is a great location for the family to go on an outing, with the grounds
                                    being large enough to enjoy a lengthy bike ride or stroll. The grounds are also
                                    ideal for a family picnic when the weather is just right, so make sure to utilise
                                    our in-built <a href="weather.html">weather</a> application to ensure you go when
                                    it's sunny.

                                        Stamford Meadows is located near the central town, just below red lion
                                        square. 
                                        With frequent visits in the summer from the
                                        ice cream van, the meadow is a great place to take the family on a day out,
                                        where you can sit and relax, play football, or watch the ducks. The meadows are in a central location, allowing you
                                        to quickly get a bag of fish and chips from a nearby chip shop and go and relax.
