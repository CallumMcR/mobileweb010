                                    Foxes tend to be a regular occurrence around Stamford for anyone who lives near a
                                    field or visits a field. These Red mammals can be found prowling around
                                    fields, hunting for mice or other prey they deem acceptable.

                                    Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera
                                    of the family Canidae. They have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a
                                    pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush).

                                        Due to the vast fields around Stamford, Black & Red Kites like to take
                                        up the sky, prowling for prey. These birds are great for any bird fanatic who
                                        wants to check off another bird on their checklist.

                                        Black & Red Kite's are relatively uncommon, but can be identified due to their
                                        medium-size. From a distance, it appears almost black, with a light
                                        brown bar on the shoulder. The plumage is actually dark brown, with scattered
                                        light brown and rufous markings, particularly on the head, neck and underparts.
                                        The tail is forked and barred with darker brown.

                                        the grass. They are typically contained within the area close to the main house,

                                        sometimes they can manage to find themselves a way out from there.
